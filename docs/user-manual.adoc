== â€‹To Create a Mule Project in Anypoint Studio 7

The ClickUp connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Below is the *"Get Lists"* operation for better understanding.

* Create new Mule Application in Studio and configure *HTTP Listener* to port 8081.
